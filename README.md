# Candidate-Search-C13
University of Richmond - Code Challenge 13 - Github Candidate API Search
Created By: "Brad Webster" - in collaboration with edX Coding Bootcamp
## Description:
As a github user myself, I find the community of open-source coding to be revolutionary. The free flow of ideas has enabled me to endlessly learn about programming. With git being the one centralized location for sharing coding knowledge, I wanted to create a fun way to discover other users and reops. Therefore I created this github user search project to pull a random github user with public information. Using typescript, react and apis, I learned how to integrate provided tools into a functional application.
